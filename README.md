## Features

- **Save Workspaces:** Capture your current set of tabs and restore them later.  

## Why I Made TabHaven

I built TabHaven mainly for myself. I use **Brave** as my browser and really liked the workspace concept in **Zen**, but Brave doesn’t have this feature built-in. I just wanted some of Zen’s workspace functionality like saving and restoring sets of tabs directly in Brave, so I made this extension.

## Installation

TabHaven is **not yet available on the Chrome Web Store**. To install locally:

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tabhaven.git
   ```
2. Open your browser’s extension manager (for example, `chrome://extensions` or `brave://extensions`).
3. Enable **Developer mode**.  
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the folder where you cloned TabHaven.  
5. Use the extension to save and restore your workspaces.
